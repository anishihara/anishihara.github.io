After my advice professor showed me, I was thrilled by the possibility to use keynote on iPad for presentation. I would just plug my VGA cable on iPad 2 and start my presentation without a notebook. A perfect combo would be control remotely the keynote on iPad using an iPhone. So, I tried to connect the two devices...

Initially, the keynote from iPad 2 could not connect to iPhone 4 on wifi or bluetooth. After a shutdown on both devices, everything worked perfectly on wifi. But, wifi is not always a option, so I began trying to connect by bluetooth. I spent two days trying to connect but nothing worked.

Later, I discovered that as my iPad 2 were on IOS 8 and my iPhone 4 on IOS 7, It is impossible to control keynote remotely. The following notice is stated on [Apple's support site](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6112):

>Note: If your remote device is using iOS 7, it will be unable to control a presentation over Bluetooth on a device using iOS 8 or later.

**Summming up, if your device is using IOS 7, it can control Keynote presentation on a device using IOS 8 over wifi but not on bluetooth.**
